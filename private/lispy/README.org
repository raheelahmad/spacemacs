This layer adds evil-friendly structural editing commands to enhance lisp
coding. It allows using powerful editing commands in ~evil-lispy-mode~ and
~lispy-mode~.

* Quick start
Start by reading the [[https://github.com/sp3ctum/evil-lispy][evil-lispy-mode]] readme.
Add ~lispy~ to your ~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ list.

** Differences from lispy-mode
If you are familiar with lispy-mode, you should know this layer changes some of
the keybindings *in evil-lispy-mode* to be more evil-like:

| Key Binding | Description                                                                         |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| o           | switch to the other side of the current expression (like o in visual mode)          |
| i           | go "inside" the current expression or jump to the next expression in this direction |
| f           | format the current expression                                                       |
| d           | move the current expression relative to its neighbors                               |
